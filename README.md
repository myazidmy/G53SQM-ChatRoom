# G53SQM-ChatRoom
Chat Server and Chat Client 

The final goal of this project is to test a message server and client and document the tests performed. The chat client and server has been decided to provide four basic functionalities:

-connection to a chat server
2- message sending function that submits text message to the server
3- a message receiving function that receives message from the chat server
4- a listing of users showing the names of users which are currently connected to the server. 

For this project, a chatroom concept has been determined to achieve this project goal. The report will be divided into three major parts which are client approach and testing, server approach and testing and finally conclusion and appendix.
